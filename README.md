# Mark Weiser’s Vision

**Mark Weiser’s vision** is best known as **“ubiquitous computing”** (often shortened to *ubicomp*), which he introduced in the late 1980s and early 1990s while working as Chief Technologist at Xerox PARC.  
His core idea was that the most profound technologies are those that **“disappear”** — becoming so seamlessly integrated into everyday life that people use them without consciously thinking about them.

## Key Principles of Weiser’s Vision

### 1. Calm Technology
- Technology should quietly serve people in the background, drawing attention only when necessary.
- Instead of demanding constant focus, devices should let users stay engaged in their primary tasks.
- The environment itself becomes “smart,” with devices communicating without user intervention.

### 2. Invisibility Through Integration
- Computing devices would be embedded into everyday objects — furniture, walls, clothing — making them effectively invisible.
- Interaction happens naturally (e.g., by touching a surface or walking into a room), not through explicit commands.

### 3. Many Devices, Not One
- Instead of a single powerful personal computer, people would interact with dozens or hundreds of small, networked devices.
- These devices would work together, sharing data and context, providing the right information at the right time.

## Weiser’s Prototypes

At Xerox PARC, Weiser’s team built early ubicomp devices to illustrate his ideas:
- **Tabs** – tiny, wearable badges or ID-card-sized devices for simple, location-aware functions.
- **Pads** – tablet-sized devices for note-taking and reading.
- **Boards** – large, wall-mounted interactive displays for group collaboration.

These were precursors to today’s smartphones, tablets, smart displays, and IoT devices.

## Impact on Modern Technology

Weiser’s vision has influenced:
- **IoT (Internet of Things)** – smart homes, wearable devices, connected cars.
- **Ambient Computing** – voice assistants (Alexa, Google Assistant), smart sensors.
- **AR/VR and Context-Aware Systems** – devices that adapt to users’ needs and environments.
- **Edge Computing** – bringing processing power closer to users for speed and privacy.
